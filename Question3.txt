Ques-3. Suggest some practical examples of using in-place and out-place techniques.
Ans-3 

In-place techniques- 
a. Bubble sort is an example of in-place sorting technique. It usually
also excludes the space used for stack in recursive algorithms. 
b. Quick sort, uses only some constant number of variables for partitioning purpose. So, is in-place algorithm.
c. insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort are also examples of in place.

Out-place techniques-
In merge sort, merge function requires extra linear space which is not
constant so it is called 'out of place' algorithm. Among the
comparison based techniques discussed, only Insertion Sort qualifies for this because of the
it processes the array from left to right and if new elements are added to the right, 
it doesnâ€™t impact the ongoing operation.
